workaholic blues

I had a great hollyday - 
my baby went away
and so I could work
all night and all the day
I've got in my river
and since the very time felt so free
but when she returned
she pulled that out of me!

she told me she talked to
all of my friends
she told me she knows the
reason hence

she will bring me from my dark house
to the light of the sun
she will take me to the city 
to the dance floor and fun
we will make love in the garden
till my knees come down
but now...

I just need to finish here a little - one tiny bug to fix, sweet, and all the dahmn project will compile. just a second honey... I swear you.

oh lord, why are you trying me
oh this torture is to severe to be
I love my man he is of noble heart
I pray, Supreme, not to tear us apart
but i'am in step to loose my reason
cause he loves his own prison
and I'd better see him unemployed then this

she told me she talked to
my mother and dad
she told me to think more
about that

she will bring me from my dark house
to the light of the sun
she will take me to the city 
to the dance floor and fun
we will make love in the garden
till my knees come down
but now...
