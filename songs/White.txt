color your imagination
in the way of no expectation
under this subordi-ordination
any effort is in vain

When you claim yourself a spectator
No matter if you have the one to complain to
You just make it all a bit safer
For what's ever sake

Could you lend me a quarter
And you know what, man?
That rubbish is rotten
So throw it away!

Rrooooopen
Your dimming eyes as wide as you can
Fall down
Blind
And nooooow
Kind of waiting for an approbation
Grab and run, grab and run
You fool

You think imma crazy?
Amazing, gazing!

Rrooooopen
Your dimming eyes as wide as you can
Fall down
Blind
And nooooow
Kind of waiting for an approbation
Grab and run, grab and run
You fool
