She said that Jesus had a twin
Who knew nothing about the firstborn sin
He was beyond the good the bad and the ugly
A lonesome heart but still he was struggling

She said the first one to land on the moon
Was brave Canadian Rocky raccoon 
In eighteen hundred ninety two
He flew a firework and landed for sure 

She said that Shakespeare wasn't indeed
He was a folly who hardly could read
But seventeen black women from Stratford 
Wrote everything that he had grabbed on

We met 
At the platform 4 of nowhere station
desperate and absorbed with isolation
I bet
But then it turned to be something
