D'you hear that scream?
I'd thought there's someone in the night has spoken
With the monsters from his
Dream
Cause it's oh so real
With the things you fill (feel)
Your heart
Like a start
For something

But then you realize it all
Oh that your eye became too old
To see the colors
Enfolded in your
Memories
Drowned in seas

And you're diving deep to catch that fish
But it slips out like it ever wasn't yours
And you remember how it sparkled bright - 
It was a diamond of your rising mind
And now it turns into a shadow
On the shallow water
