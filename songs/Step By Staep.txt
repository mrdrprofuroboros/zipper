So here it, 
here I, 
here I'm just 
A little guy who's lost of his way
Who am, 
where ain't 
my place
Is the question that may change day by day
And if you 
could know 
which road 
We were following the rest of the night
I'd say you lie to me
Oh baby you lie to me...

Lost in the mirrors and bound to dates
We'll vanish our souls and make them efface
But when 
we stand - 
there'll be nothing!
So pull up together and wake up your dreams
It's easy enough when there's something that beams
The way. 
And you'll see - 
step by step...

Then when
I'll leave 
this place
There'll be nothing in the past to recede
But still I
can't find 
it why
Am I always feeling so incomplete
And if you
could know
since what time
Have we been fleeding from our shadows and prints
I'd say you lie to me
Oh baby you lie to me...

Lost in the mirrors and bound to dates
We'll vanish our souls and make them efface
But when 
we stand - 
there'll be nothing!
So pull up together and wake up your dreams
It's easy enough when there's something that beams
The way. 
And you'll see - 
step by step...
