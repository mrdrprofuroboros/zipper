Some falls before I felt 
a little stronger, 
But now I hardly 
recognize myself... 
I cannot stand my mind 
no bit of longer, 
And hate my soul, 
dying in its shell! 

I could have managed 
change my life - 
Got over love betrays 
and lies, 
But I am still too weak 
to make the step... 

How frequently the wheel 
of fortune stopped here - 
Just right between 
the blessing and the curse. 
I pray you on the knees 
to keep my fears, 
Or else my solitude 
will grow much worse. 

If mankind is so 
flat to roots, 
And living just devouring 
goods - 
Farewell to every single 
effort done... 

I made myself be choosing 
here the future, 
Though all varieties are 
chained by fate. 
It might be like with life 
in struggle feature 
When you fall dead as 
victim for the great... 

I'm staying here alone
and wait for wonder
As scarecrow doomed
on solitude
I wish my troubles vanish
with the thunder
To clear all around the place
I stood

This wierd 
merry-go-round, 
That rush's both rabbits 
like a hound, 
Can leave me going mad 
without you...
