This day wasn't best day: 
'Ve lost some money - but that's OK. 
I belive when tomorrow comes 
I'll gonna stop to be all thumbs! 

And I Smile on! 
Enbrightning' the street, 
Enfrightnin' our greed 
on feelings! 
I say: Come on! 
Enlighten the bold, 
Enheightnin' this world 
of cielings! 

Come on! Smile on! Oh yeah! 

I got up fresh and new, 
Inspired with a thought of you. 
Spilled the coffee cup - a habbit of mine - 
It seemed a good day - starting sign. 

I —Ålose my eyes: and you so smart 
Fly me winged along the boulevard. 
And here I am, but when I knock on the door 
You shout you cannot even see me no more! 

But I still Smile on! 
Enbrightning' the street, 
Enfrightnin' our greed 
on feelings! 
And I say: Come on! 
Enlighten the bold, 
Enheightnin' this world 
of cielings!

Come on! Smile on! Oh yeah! 

So this day wasn't best day, 
But I keep smile on anyway - 
'Cause I belive when tomorrow comes 
I'll gonna have another chance! 

And I Smile on! 
Enbrightning' the street, 
Enfrightnin' our greed 
on feelings! 
I say: Come on! 
Enlighten the bold, 
Enheightnin' this world 
of cielings! 

Come on! Smile on! Oh yeah!
