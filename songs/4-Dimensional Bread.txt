A horrible creature is hiding in my kitchen,
Looking so friendly, but that is a hype.
A shadow in our world, seems so like a fiction,
Laughing at us in ironical wipe

It does pretty nothing, but the danger is real -
Before you would say it is harmless.
Your reason is strong with the things it can feel
And makes you go crazy with others

Four-dimensional bread -
Is the loaf you are looking at!
Four-dimensional bread -
Kind of bread you have never met!
Four-dimensional bread -
The thing I wish I have never had!
Four-dimensional bread -
Pure evil, that drives me mad!

Turn off your imagination -
Brake through usual abstract view!
There's no any explanation
How badly it alters you.

But if you want to make it out -
Remember that I warned you:
Whenever you'll try to hide -
It will just blow your mind!

Four-dimensional bread -
Is the loaf you are looking at!
Four-dimensional bread -
Kind of bread you have never met!
Four-dimensional bread -
The thing I wish I have never had!
Four-dimensional bread -
Pure evil, that drives me mad!

So why am I still not
In a long-sleeve white shirt?
An asylum-seeker found his home indeed.

Cause the place where I live
Makes it hard to believe
" - Oh, hi, Napoleon!"
That the guys around me can be insane!

Four-dimensional bread -
Is the loaf you are looking at!
Four-dimensional bread -
Kind of bread you have never met!
Four-dimensional bread -
The thing I wish I have never had!
Four-dimensional bread -
Pure evil, that drives me mad!
