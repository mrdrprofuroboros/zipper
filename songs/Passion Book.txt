My passion book, my holy grail of questions to the world
I'm so afraid to ask you what's the meaning of my life
My black scrap note, my little endless vessel can't you hold
My tunes and airs, my fairy tales of what have I made wrong?

You worship language more than time and time revenges you
You're all so scratched, your red band stretched and pages went away
They've passed to those I've trusted most and they were so few
The ones who've changed my life and made a step along my way

If I was strong enough to chase my phantoms in the haze
Of doubts and hesitations round the vanity of quest
I would have rather tried to meet the answer face-to-face
Than kept deluding more and more in my attempts to guess

My heritage of folly and the testament of truth
You're just a tiny needle in the ocean of hay
My curiosity to life, the relic of my youth
Confuse me now, refuse my vow and give my mind a break
