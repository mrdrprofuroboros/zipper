Here is your long long way
With many paintings on the wall
You have to run away
To get it free at all

Here you can’t hide your real feelling
Here you can’t find another way
Here your emotions have no meaning
You will be running not one day

Your life in fact is not indeed
But you keep aim the end despite
You've lost at all your creed
And lost at all your real might

Here you can’t hide your real feelling
Here you can’t find another way
Here your emotions have no meaning
You will be running not one day

No one can help you, friend
This just your problem, just your path
It’s getting now the thing I meant
Your picture’s just illusive lust

Here you can’t hide your real feelling
Here you can’t find another way
Here your emotions have no meaning
You will be running not one day
