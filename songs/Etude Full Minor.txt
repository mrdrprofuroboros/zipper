I don't wanna be a fake comedian
Or a lieing abuse for a kingdom of poverty
I change my religion I ask the providence
What a beautiful piece for shades of my soul is
This grinding lady to seat on the cementry
And waiting for nobody's damned allowances 
This piano is starving for a real composer
So give me a name and ill banish my presence here
