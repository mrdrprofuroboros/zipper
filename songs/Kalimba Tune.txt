I’m sitting at the station
Waiting for my train
And I’d hardly back down to the
Place I’ve been

D’you want to see the world they’ve asked me, yeah
D’you want to figure out
Is there anybody waiting for you
The one with the same doubts 

I met you
At the nowhere’s end, at the no man’s pier
Where all roads
Seemed to disappear 

Run (run) run
Or you can fall down
Under the snow
Under snow and never

Wake up strong,
Come back home, 
See your face and
Hear you laughing 

Wait up there
Cause I won’t let you

And I feel so lost
Like a deep into exhaust
You can start to cry
To tear the splinter from my eye

I met you
At the nowhere’s end, at the no man’s pier
Where all roads
Seemed to disappear 

Run (run) run
Or you can fall down
Under the snow
Under snow and never

Wake up strong,
Come back home, 
See your face and
Hear you laughing 

Wait up there
Cause I won’t let you
