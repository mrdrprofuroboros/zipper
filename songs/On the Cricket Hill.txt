The stars are slowly
Crawling over
The curtain of the
Night 

And so misterIOusly
The clouds have folded into

Cardboard paintings
Hanged on to the
Top of world to
Swing

And I'm sitting in the parter
Waiting for the show...

And here it goes
A little lighthouse in the sea of rye -
So i climb down the valley
Passing by the water mill
To meet the firefly on the cricket hill

How could it turn out that you could only
Hide away among that crickets
I believe that you're the lonely
One as I am

Why did you left all behind the river-
Side and threw it all away
You knew they wont ever see the
Light you share

and for Now you could have truely done more than I could 
Do without any support of chance
but You know i couldn't take it easy as should
You do if you were on place of mine

Cause I 
lost My luck and
I
now I'm Stucked at
Virtually nothing 
Like in the middle of the
Stream
So just

wait for me
Stay for me
I want to know
How to make it 
Feel like the
Star burns inside of
Me

Inside out
Outside in
Now everything's
Mixed In the
World that i
Used to think I'm 
In

But Now I crawl
And if I fall
Just push me down
Harder so
I could reach
The darkest of the
Caves

And from the bottom
I will ob-serve 
the un-tangled
re-ality
Settled in
Flames

I feel like the morning stars are crushing 
And I wait for the last of them to fall on me 
When I will be dancing in the fire 
That burns on every step I've paved my way

Then I will eagerly desire 
The most unappreciated sign 
To be shown as an evanescent image 
Reflecting in every face I see
