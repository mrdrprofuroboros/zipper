Oh constable, why cant't you see:
You can't suspect a lad submerged under sea
Why could it be wrong or why could it be true
Is not supposed to mock you

You need a rest or, say, a certain romance
To recreate the former depth of your glance
and To be quite asured that the days you'll have met -
Are not the days to regret

You look so patient but that's an exhaust
Of conscientious attitude to your post
You've strained yourself and reached the verge of your own
But still your heart is a stone!

Oh constable, that's not your fault
It's your profession to reason so cold
But when you get home to your empty flat
Now it is time to forget

When you were a child
You knew this life better
And nothing could alter your world
Your laughter was clear
And the drop of your tear
Was never so terribly cold!

Oh constable, that's not your fault
I know it's your part to reason so cold
It's conscientious attitude to your post
Wow oh

I say, constable, that's not your fault
I know it's your part to reason so cold
You've strained yourself and reached the verge of your own
But still your heart is a stone!
