I was told
There would be 
Nothing nothing for me
But I'm still waiting for appropriate and conscientiously adopted way to keep my promises and doubts untangled slightly as it goes

When
It will all end up?!
And I could get
My ticket to home

Where all the ways not closed
And the radio stays in tune
Where the streets all over the place are covered
With the smiles of children's joy

My home town
Where I belong
Is filling my imagination
For so long

Then I was warned
That all decisions of the darkest days
Will reappear again as shadows of the moments that I forced to pass away

When 
will I break this down?!
But this dream town seems to stuck on the face of the clock

Where all your ways are open
And you know what to choose
Where your tiny flat is always full
With the friends of youth

My home town
Where I belong
Is filling my imagination
For so long
