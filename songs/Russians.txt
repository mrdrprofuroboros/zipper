We'we got winter in fall 
And another in spring 
But we never get cold 
'Cause we are here to swing 

We sway over seas 
And we fly over stars 
But we boil our kettles 
With the heat of our hearts 

We can ride any road 
And we won't tell you where 
'Cause you'd never believe 
We were riding a bear 

We can solve any problem 
We can shave with an axe 
So every time we get stumbled 
We look back to our tracks 

We'we got prices in rubles 
For everything here 
From buckweat and sugar 
To even something nuklear 

Our atom is peacefull 
And that you can trust 
But our spirit is a 
Volatile gas 

We'we got winter in fall 
And another in spring 
But we never get cold 
'Cause we are here to swing 

We sway over seas 
And we fly over stars 
But we boil our kettles 
With the heat of our hearts
