Game for real
Take your risks and I'll be
Here with you when you take my breath
To start again

Drop
Drop your dice - don't you have a couple?
Would it be fair when you realize?
Drop 
Drop your dice
Try your fate out!
Scared?! Scared?! Scaaaaaared?!

Don't play
Don't play
Or I won't 
Do what I want to do
Say what I want to say
Ok
You won this time

Drop
Drop your dice - don't you have a couple?
Would it be fair when you realize?
Drop 
Drop your dice
Try your fate out!
Scared?! Scared?! Scaaaaaared?!
