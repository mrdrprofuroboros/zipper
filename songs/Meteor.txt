Desert me
This space is no longer yours
Observe me
An unreachable spot from earth

Cause I'm drifting away
In this kingdom of night
Leaving all that I had behind

I'm the only fish in this ocean
I'm the only bird got so high
But I'm not choosing where to fly

Desert me
This space is no longer yours
Observe me
An unreachable spot from earth

Cause I'm drifting away
In this kingdom of night
Leaving all that I love aside
my heart

I'm the only fish in this ocean
I'm the only bird got so high
But I'm not choosing where to fly

I'm the only fish in this ocean
I'm the only bird got so high
But I'm not even choosing 
Where to fly
