How pity it was
To see you there
Lost in a crowd of people
Lost like a silver needle

And I saw your face
Your pale gray eyes
Through the smoke of the room
And obsessive vile lies

And your glance was passing over
Throughout this transparent glass
Of the middle class spectators
With their riddled looks at us

And we're out in the clouds
And that's all we've dreamed about
The frontier stratosphere 
To get lost in, to get lost in

Cause we're gone with the wind
And our prints just swept with tides
And she tries, I see she tries
To feel as high as we fly

But oh no 
No - she's bound to the ground
Cause her dreams were the realm of day
And I'm wondering oh how could they
And I'm wondering oh how could they
Become her hideaway 

And I'm down - in her sea
In a search of place for me
There's so many roads entangled
And so many ships are wrecked 

And I met there a fish
Quirry yellow jolly fish
Sparkling fearless round an anchor
With seven chains arise like trees

And I rushed and crushed the chains
So the jolly fish now reigns
In her sea of memory
But we are free

And we're out in the clouds
And that's all we've dreamed about
The frontier stratosphere 
To get lost in
