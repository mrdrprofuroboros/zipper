Those thougts - they weren’t up for me
But it was crucial for the point of view that
You would have taken by that time… oh mine
But you’re so overly attached
I didn’t knew I’ll get used so mush to
You…

But I feel
Like the rhythm of this song
Is now fully growing strong
Every second, every breath and
Every place That I belong

But you know I
Would wait for a while
‘Cause sometimes
I want it all
To make me free

And I raise
My voice and prayers so
You could hear me!

Whenever I did try to hide my gruesome thoughts and feelings
You did it right to give a talk to me
But I-I-I-I-I tried to be tender
Though couldn’t find compassion in my words…

You thought you could have stoped that flavor of a fascination
With her attendance in my apathetic heart
But she imbued my work with new obsession
That you unraveled with your faithful eye

Before I lied about
That shade of a doubt
And you were repeating around and around
How you wanted to be so proud

Of your man, but then 
It turned out to be the end
And so again and again
All your credence for me - in vain
