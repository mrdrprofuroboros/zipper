You lit me like a candle
Cause knew that life's a gas
You've got it under my jazz
And filled all empty notes in my chest

I feel your heartbeat echoes mine
And in a thousand miles
I still could hear it strong
Cause I know .... that you love me

You dive me deep
Drive me hard and fly me high
You let the harshfull starlight
Shine me the way in the night

I feel your heartbeat echoes mine
And in a thousand miles
I still could hear it strong
Cause I know .... that you love me
