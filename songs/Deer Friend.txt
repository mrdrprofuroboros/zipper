Hello my deer-friend,
I'm writing you
The things you knew
But now won't understand

You've lost your mind
In deep surender 
To weaker gender
And almost got rewind

You bend your knees
Beneath the fashion
Think' it's casual
No resist for peace

Deer-friend, deer-friend
Living in the sphere-land
Thinking the world is
Empty inside
Deer-friend, deer-friend
Living in the fear-land
Cutting your soul round
To the shape of breed

A "desert rose" or red:
You're asking for advice
But fist think twice
Cause i'm getting pretty mad

And time to time 
I see you fading
Out from brain invading
Got you high....on

And then i still believe
To save you 
From the wave of
Fucking self-deceive

Deer-friend, deer-friend
Living in the sphere-land
Thinking the world is
Empty inside
Deer-friend, deer-friend
Living in the fear-land
Cutting your soul round
To the shape of breed
