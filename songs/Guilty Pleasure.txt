Oh baby, I want it so bad
You've stuck it over in my head
I burn inside with desire
You play with fire

I feel like sucking in freedom
The lie I want to succeed in
I know it's shame and disgrace
This embrace

Guilty pleasure
I'm just failing to resist
Guilty pleasure, baby
Give me more of this

Dirty passion
Now devours me
Satisfaction
Is the only thing I see

Oh baby I want it so mad
You're stuck it strongly in my head
And every time I catch your eye
It's not alright

I know you crave it as I do
I cant't accuse or inclune you
It started over from me
And turned out to misery

When do you touch me baby
It makes me oh so much
And in the middle of the night in strangling isolation
I see your silhouette line

This burning conscience inquisition
Erases all my honesty
But I surrender to your wish on
Me

Guilty pleasure
I'm just failing to resist
Guilty pleasure, baby
Give me more of this

Dirty passion
Now devours me
Satisfaction
Is the only thing I see
