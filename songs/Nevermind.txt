That day was the last of the empty days
I've just wanted to see how silence breaks
And since I've lost my zero point of view
The mess of thoughts strained into the accurate queue

Never mind anything you've done before
and Overwrite the string of future evermore
Pray yourself to be the one who makes the world
Love and feel how widely can your heart unfold

It's my confession to live like a man of truth
With all the passion I crave it to spread on you
My mind is free out of tangled web of lies and wrath
Cause I am moving ... at my own path

Never mind anything you've done before
and Overwrite the string of future evermore
Pray yourself to be the one who makes the world
Love and feel how widely can your heart unfold

If you could colour your life into shades of spring
You'll get astonished with changes it would have bring
... You'll be a man of no disgace
Like born again to a better place

Never mind anything you've done before
and Overwrite the string of future evermore
Pray yourself to be the one who makes the world
Love and feel how widely can your heart unfold
